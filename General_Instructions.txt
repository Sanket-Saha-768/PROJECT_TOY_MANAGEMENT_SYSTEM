1. Project is to have a menu-driven command-line interface without any graphics.
2. Use of files is highly encouraged. Project can begin by reading the information from files. Output can also be printed onto files wherever applicable.
3. If files are not used, input from user is to be taken at the beginning of running the project.
4. Use of C++ STL is mandatory.
5. Use of an IDE (eg., Netbeans, Eclipse, CodeBlocks, etc.) is encouraged. Create a project in your respective IDE and write the code in seperate files.
6. Project should be divided into 3 files:
    (a) main.cpp – containing only the main function.
    (b) myheader.h – containing all function declarations.
    (c) mysource.cpp – containing all function definitions.
    Files to be appropriately included and properly compiled.
7. For any query, you can meet me on Wednesdays and Thursdays between 11 am and 3 pm in the new CSE faculty room. Please send an email or WhatsApp me beforehand and fix up a time.

8. Start out simple and gradually add features as you are comfortable.
